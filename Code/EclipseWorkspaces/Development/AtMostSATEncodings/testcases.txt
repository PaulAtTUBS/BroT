== Neat Cases
5 1 - Neat for testing

== Interesting Cases
5 2 yes - Dead Feature in Commander
5 2 no  - Commander Model is void

15 3 - Commander: Look at It0 and It1. They are exactly the same and only differ by g and s. Maybe these could be chosen more wisely in the first place?
				  Maybe the condition to use the binomial method in the recursion instead is too strong. => Test deeper commander recursions and dont break so fast.
